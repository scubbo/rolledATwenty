<h1>But I Rolled A Nat Twenty!</h1>

<p><strong>So?</strong></p>

<p>
    There is a common misconception among players of D&D 5e that a nat 20 is a license to "do
    anything" - that a nat20 on an Athletics check lets you jump to the moon, a nat20 on Persuasion
    can convince a king to abdicate, a nat20 on Medicine can heal the patient to full health. These
    are sometimes called "Critical Successes" (mirroring "Critical Hits/Misses" in combat), or
    "Skill Crits".
</p>

<p>
    Not only is this rule not Rules-As-Written (which is fine - every group has their own set of
    house rules that they adopt!), but it's actually a counter-productive rule that can harm
    gameplay. This page lays out the reasons why it's harmful, and then refutes some of the
    arguments in favour of it.
</p>

<h2>Why Skill Crits are harmful to play</h2>

TK - power-scaling, suspension of disbelief

TK - undermines skill-based classes (outline the three pillars)

<h2>Common arguments in favour of Skill Crits</h2>

<h3>It's in the rules!</h3>

<p>
    No it's not. This is the <i>least</i> important justification (since you can house-rule whatever
    you want - see "But I want to, and so does my group!", below), but just to be clear - it's not.
</p>

<p>
    You or your group might be confusing this with "Critical Hits/Misses", where a roll of 20 on an
    attack roll always hits (and does extra damage), and a roll of 1 always misses (Even this rule
    is often misunderstood - the rule that "something else bad" happens on a Critical Miss, like
    dropping a weapon or falling prone, is also not Rules-As-Written).
</p>

<h4>But if Crit Hits/Misses are ok, why aren't Skill Crits?</h4>

<p>
    TK - Watsonian, combat is a contest. A Crit Miss can be your opponent getting a lucky deflection
    even though you hopelessly outclass them. Doylist - combat's not a "gate", if you miss an
    attack you can try again (or circumvent it)
</p>

<h3>If a 20 can't possibly succeed, then why even roll?</h3>

<p>
    TK - yes, true. It's bad DM-ing to allow a player to roll for something they can't make _any_
    impact on - but the DMs idea of what counts as a success might be different from yours. Skill
    checks are not necessarily binary pass-fail - there might be differing DCs for gradations of
    success, even if "20 plus your modifiers" still won't result in the outcome that <i>you</i> are
    hoping for.
</p>

<h3>TK - Any other arguments in favour of them?</h3>

<h3>But I want to play with Skill Crits, and so does my group!</h3>

<p>
    Then - cool! The only wrong way to play Role-playing games is any way that your group doesn't
    enjoy. Just make sure that everyone knows what they're signing up for, and particularly that
    the players of skill-based classes don't feel over-shadowed.
